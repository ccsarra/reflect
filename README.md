ICT for this 2nd Quarter was a bit easier than the first. 
However, I still experienced a bunch of diffculties, especially 
with the performance tasks. Similar to the previous quarter, 
time management was hard for me during the hands-on activities 
since there was a time pressure. I'm willing to improve however, 
because coding is really fun.
